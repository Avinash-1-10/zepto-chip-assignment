## 

The **Chip Generator** is a React application that provides a user-friendly interface for dynamically generating chips from a list of items. Users can easily filter and select items, which are then transformed into chips. The application includes features such as automatic adjustment, chip removal, and enhanced backspace functionality.

## Features

- **Dynamic Chip Generation:** The list of items dynamically updates based on user input, and chips are generated for selected items.
- **Automatic Adjustment:** The input field adjusts dynamically as items are selected or removed, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Chip Removal:** Each generated chip includes an "X" icon for easy removal. Clicking the "X" removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.
- **Backspace Functionality:** When the input is blank, pressing backspace highlights the last chip. Pressing backspace again removes the highlighted chip.
